# Controller methods and views

By [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT)

We have a good start to the movie app, but the presentation is not ideal. We don't want to see the time (12:00:00 AM in the image below) and **ReleaseDate** should be two words.

![Index view: Release Date is one word (no space) and every movie release date shows a time of 12 AM](../../tutorials/first-mvc-app/working-with-sql/_static/m55.png)

Open the *Models/Movie.cs* file and add the highlighted lines shown below:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc/sample/MvcMovie/Models/MovieDate.cs?name=snippet_1&highlight=2,11-12)]

Build and run the app.

<!-- include start
![MVC Movie application open browser showing movie data](../../tutorials/first-mvc-app/working-with-sql/_static/m55.png)

 -->
