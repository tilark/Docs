# Getting Started with ASP.NET Core

1.  Install [.NET Core](https://microsoft.com/net/core)

2.  Create a new .NET Core project:

    ```terminal
    mkdir aspnetcoreapp
    cd aspnetcoreapp
    dotnet new web
    ```
    
    Notes: 
    - On macOS and Linux, open a terminal window. On Windows, open a command prompt.
    - Previous versions of .NET Core required a `t` parameter, that is   `dotnet new -t web`. If you get an error running `dotnet new web`, install the latest [.NET Core](https://microsoft.com/net/core).  `dotnet` (with no parameters)  will display the .NET Core version.

3.  Restore the packages:

    ```terminal
    dotnet restore
    ```

4.  Run the app  (the `dotnet run` command will build the app when it's out of date):

    ```terminal
    dotnet run
    ```

5.  Browse to `http://localhost:5000`

An ASP.NET Core app can use the .NET Core or .NET Framework runtime. For more information, see [Choosing between .NET Core and .NET Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/standard/choosing-core-framework-server).
